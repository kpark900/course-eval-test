I've created a script that:

Creates distribution plots for Survey1-7, including:

Normal distribution curves
Mean lines (dashed red)
Quartile lines (Q1, Median, Q3)
Statistical annotations


Features:

Interactive Plotly visualizations
Subplots for all survey questions
Statistical overlays
Comprehensive error handling
Logging for debugging


Output:

Generates an HTML file with interactive plots
Saves in a 'visualizations' subdirectory
Includes hover information and statistics



Would you like me to:

Add any additional statistical information to the plots?
Modify the visual style or layout?
Add more interactive features?

====
I've created a new script (advanced_survey_analyzer.py) that:

Inherits from the original SurveyStatisticsAnalyzer class
Adds new advanced statistical measures:

Reliability metrics (Cronbach's alpha, split-half)
Response pattern analysis
Advanced statistical tests
Factor analysis


Includes comprehensive output:

Separate Excel file for advanced metrics
Detailed console summaries
Multiple analysis sheets


Maintains compatibility with the original script while adding:

More sophisticated statistical measures
Advanced pattern analysis
Deeper insights into survey structure



Would you like me to:

Add any additional statistical measures?
Modify the output format?
Add specific visualizations?
Enhance any particular analysis?

I've created a comprehensive script that:

Creates detailed analysis of survey scores with:

Individual question breakdowns (Survey1-Survey7)
Combined survey score analysis
Analysis by course, college, and campus


Outputs results in multiple formats:

Excel workbook with multiple sheets for each analysis level
Summary statistics in console output
Detailed breakdowns with count, mean, and standard deviation


Key features:

Handles missing or invalid data
Provides comprehensive error handling
Creates summary statistics
Sorts results for easy interpretation
Rounds values appropriately


The Excel output includes:

Individual sheets for each analysis level
Summary sheet with key statistics
Properly formatted tables with statistics



Would you like me to:

Add additional statistical measures?
Include visualization capabilities?
Add more detailed breakdowns or comparisons?
Modify the output format or structure?
